# AppMesh Demo leveraging CDK
This demo leverages several AWS services including _CodeBuild, ECS/Fargate, AppMesh, Application Load Balancing_ etc.
It uses Python and the CDK (Cloud Development Toolkit), so provided you have Python 3.6+ and version 0.33 of the CDK
installed, the commands below should all work.

# Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

# Note
The demo is a conversion of one that used multiple CloudFormation templates and bash scripts

Enjoy!
